# What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared?

Undeclared variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using var, let or const.

A variable that is undefined is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. 

A variable that is null will have been explicitly assigned to the null value
